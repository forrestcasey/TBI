## Hypothesis: 
In our analysis, we will look at the degree to which TBIs affect different age demographics. We also explore variation in the mechanisms causing TBIs for the different age groups. Given the above, we seek to provide information that will identify key areas of improvement & prevention for each age group, allowing more effective steps to be taken for TBI education and prevention.
